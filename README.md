========
My solutions to Advent of Code 2024. I will be trying to do nearly every day in a different programming language,
some of which I have never used before, or used very little.

## Day 1
These solutions are in Clojure. This is the first Clojure code I have ever written, so it's probably not very good.

Regardless, I enjoyed this little introduction to the Lisp family of languages.

## Day 2
These solutions are in Rust. I'd say I am intermediate at Rust, but it's been a little while since I've written any. Rust is just as good as I remember.

## Day 3
These solutions are in Python. Python is one of my first programming languages from way back in 2012 or so. This isn't the cleanest code but I wrote it quick and it works.

## Day 4
These solutions are in Ruby. Ruby is one of the languages I'm most proficient in, but this is also not the cleanest code due to time constraints as with Day 3.

## Day 5
These solutions are in TypeScript. TypeScript is one of my favorite languages. I'm happy with the implementation I came up for it, though I'm sure it could be improved.

## Day 6
These solutions are in Go. It's been awhile since I've worked in Go, so this was a nice refresher. The implementation for Part 2 is a bit bruteforcey, and I'd love to figure
out a more efficient way to do it.
