========
My solutions to Advent of Code 2024. I will be trying to do nearly every day in a different programming language,
some of which I have never used before, or used very little.

## Day 1
These solutions are in Clojure. This is the first Clojure code I have ever written, so it's probably not very good.

Regardless, I enjoyed this little introduction to the Lisp family of languages.

## Day 2
These solutions are in Rust. I'd say I am intermediate at Rust, but it's been a little while since I've written any. Rust is just as good as I remember.

## Day 3
These solutions are in Python. Python is one of my first programming languages from way back in 2012 or so. This isn't the cleanest code but I wrote it quick and it works.

## Day 4
These solutions are in Ruby. Ruby is one of the languages I'm most proficient in, but this is also not the cleanest code due to time constraints as with Day 3.

## Day 5
These solutions are in TypeScript. TypeScript is one of my favorite languages. I'm happy with the implementation I came up for it, though I'm sure it could be improved.

## Day 6
These solutions are in Go. It's been awhile since I've worked in Go, so this was a nice refresher. The implementation for Part 2 is a bit bruteforcey, and I'd love to figure
out a more efficient way to do it.

## Day 7
These solutions are in Haskell. I have never written anything significant in Haskell before. Writing this kind of felt like my brain was upside down. It was a lot of fun at first, though.

The implementation is very much a bruteforce, however, I just really don't feel like optimizing it right now when I'm this new to the Haskell language and I already have a headache. I recognize there are many opportunities for improvement, such as only evaluating part of each sequence, and skipping the whole thing if it starts to yield a result that is bigger than the expected result. This would be trivial for me to figure out in procedural language. Maybe I'll revisit this solution sometime once I'm done the month!
