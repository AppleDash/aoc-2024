========
My solutions to Advent of Code 2024. I will be trying to do nearly every day in a different programming language,
some of which I have never used before, or used very little.

## Day 1
These solutions are in Clojure. This is the first Clojure code I have ever written, so it's probably not very good.

Regardless, I enjoyed this little introduction to the Lisp family of languages.
